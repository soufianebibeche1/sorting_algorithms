Sorting Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort by [Your Name] and [Your Partner's Name] for the ALX School learning program. The goal of this project is to implement and understand various sorting algorithms in the C programming language while adhering to specific guidelines and constraints.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms in C.
- Understand and explain the concept of Big O notation for evaluating the time complexity of an algorithm.
- Select the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given input based on its characteristics.
- Implement a stable sorting algorithm.
- Demonstrate knowledge of data structures, focusing on doubly linked lists.

## Project Structure

### Files

## Coding Style
The code adheres to the Betty style, as checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

## Restrictions

## Testing
For testing the sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers, you can use Random.org or any other suitable testing method.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and related concepts. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to soufiane.bibeche97@gmail.com.

Happy Coding!
